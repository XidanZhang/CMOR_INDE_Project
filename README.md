# Logistic Regression Algorithm

## Introduction
Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification. It uses the logistic function to model the probability of a binary outcome.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a synthetic binary classification dataset generated using scikit-learn's `make_classification` function. It has two features and one binary target variable.

- **Number of samples**: 100
- **Number of features**: 2
- **Classes**: 0 and 1

## How to Run
1. Open the `logistic_regression.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Load and visualize the dataset.
   - Train the Logistic Regression model.
   - Visualize the decision boundary.

## Results
The decision boundary plot demonstrates how logistic regression separates the two classes.

## Files Included
- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `logistic_regression_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
