# Perceptron Algorithm

## Introduction
The perceptron is a simple binary classification algorithm that updates weights based on misclassified data points. It is one of the foundational algorithms in supervised machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a synthetic binary classification dataset generated using scikit-learn's `make_classification` function. It has two features (`Feature1` and `Feature2`) and a binary target variable (`Label`).

- **Number of samples**: 100
- **Number of features**: 2
- **Classes**: -1 and 1

## How to Run
1. Open the `perceptron.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Load and visualize the dataset.
   - Train the Perceptron model.
   - Visualize the decision boundary.

## Results
The decision boundary plot demonstrates how the perceptron separates the two classes in the dataset.

## Files Included
- `perceptron.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `perceptron_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
