# Linear Regression Algorithm

## Introduction
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous target variables. It finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the observed and predicted values.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a synthetic regression dataset generated using scikit-learn's `make_regression` function. It has one feature and one continuous target variable.

- **Number of samples**: 100
- **Number of features**: 1
- **Noise**: 10 (to simulate real-world variability)

## How to Run
1. Open the `linear_regression.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Load and visualize the dataset.
   - Train the Linear Regression model.
   - Visualize the regression line.

## Results
The plot demonstrates how the linear regression model fits the dataset, showing the actual data points and the predicted regression line.

## Files Included
- `linear_regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `linear_regression_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
